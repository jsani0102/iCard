iCard
============

An iOS app that allows users to create social media business cards
in order to aggregate social media usernames and handles across different
platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

This project was originally a CS50 final project, but I have decided to
pursue it further and see how far I can take it. I am currently improving upon the project at Hack Harvard's HackWeek.

Please take a look at iCard's MVP [screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rqe_iv8Yjo) for the CS50 Fair.
